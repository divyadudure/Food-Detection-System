# Food-Detection-System
This project focuses on building an IoT-based food detection system that identifies food items such as rice, dal, curry, milk, and oil using real-time camera input and machine learning. Instead of physical sensors, the system simulates sensor behavior and uses a camera as a visual sensor to extract meaningful features for food classification.
